Leveraging Machine Learning to Bridge the Gap between Simple and Complex Traits in Job Applicants Data

Problem:
During an interview, we can observe various traits such as attentiveness, calmness, confidence, communication skills, and creativity.
However, predicting a candidate's persistence, a crucial trait for many roles, is challenging.
Can we leverage machine learning to predict a candidate's complex traits like persistence based on their responses and observed traits during an interview?


Overview:
● Development of a machine learning model that connects observable traits from a physical interview to complex, unobservable traits. 
● Utilization of XGBoost and Polynomial Regression to predict complex traits based on simple ones.
● Exploration of the potential of machine learning in enhancing traditional interview processes.
